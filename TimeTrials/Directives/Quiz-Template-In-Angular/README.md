Quiz Template in AngularJS
==========================


The templating and binding features of AngularJS make it really intriguing tool for creating interactive quizzes and training programs.



Goals of this project:

Test-Simulator
=============

have students practice test questions using this library for Latex and equations:

https://raw.github.com/Mathapedia/LaTeX2HTML5/master/latex2html5.min.js


three.js, audio, and video questions can be included as well (low res videos).

These would be good for simulators:




Persoal Records
===============

Students can sign into a website and try increasing their achievements on each one -- possibly for brownie points (given away at the end of the day).

Homework-Generator
=================

Actual homework which can be assigned with randomized numbers.  Will open-source.
