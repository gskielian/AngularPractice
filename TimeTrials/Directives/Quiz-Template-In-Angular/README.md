Quiz Template in AngularJS
==========================


The templating and binding features of AngularJS make it really intriguing tool for creating interactive quizzes and training programs.



Goals of this project:

Test-Simulator
=============

have students practice test questions using this library for Latex and equations:

https://raw.github.com/Mathapedia/LaTeX2HTML5/master/latex2html5.min.js


three.js, audio, and video questions can be included as well (low res videos).

These would be good for simulators, but real tests are all so wordy.


Lab Simulator
=============

Before and after lab, students will test their understanding and view progress with a test simulator.

For my upcoming mechanics section this will include:

1. aiming a cannon ball (three.js and html5 canvas implementations) -- at different targets, three.js collisiondetect
  *getting 10 right grants you fluffy cat ball, planet, perhaps different actions (cows fall from the sky or someting).
2. guessing when the ball will hit the ground (three.js canvas and Date.time() method)
3. visualizing the vectors of angular momentum
4. Visualizing Free body diagrams
5. Visualizing independence of motion -- three cameras, one top down, one side one free-perspective. showing constant x-velocity, parabolic y-velocity.
6. Momentum conservation
7. Elastic Collision Simulations

10% leniency for guesses (if ranges and boolean, easy)


Personal Records
===============

Students can sign into a website and try increasing their achievements on each one -- possibly for brownie points (given away at the end of the day).

Homework-Generator
=================

Actual homework which can be assigned with randomized numbers.  Will open-source.
